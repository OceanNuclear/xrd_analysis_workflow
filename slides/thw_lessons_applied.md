# About myself

- Field: Materials Science and Engineering
- Research area: corrosion of Ti alloys for implants
- No formal programming training

# The enlightenment moments

- drawing thousands of lines in ppts: there must be a better way! Started learning Python
- the first THW seminar by Matt in March 2018

# Goals

- Identify crystalline phases in the corrosion products
- Determine the location of identified cryst. ph. relative to 

# My computational needs

- Plot x-y data
- Simple statistical analysis: mean, standard deviation
- ...

# Objectives

- Create a workflow to analyse my synchrotron data, which is:
- reproducible
- ...

# Tools

- Keep it simple!
